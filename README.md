## Introduction
This repository contains a subset of the assingments done in the course.

## [Assignment 7 - Palm tree detector](https://github.com/Isac-AS/40982-Vision-por-Computador/tree/main/CV-P7-Isac-Github)
Yes! YOLOv7 was trained to detect _palm trees_. The dataset, procedure, results and weights are all there.

## [Assignment 6 - Face comparison tool](https://github.com/Isac-AS/40982-Vision-por-Computador/tree/main/VC_P6_Isac)
Upon execution any face in the frames recorded by the camera will be detected. Press "f" to "lock" that first face. 
Any other faces that appear afterwards will shown a percentage on how "similar" the faces are by comparing feature vectors.

## [Assignment 5 - License plate detector](https://github.com/Isac-AS/40982-Vision-por-Computador/tree/main/VC_P5_Isac)
No need for explanation.

## [Assignment 4 - Clown mode](https://github.com/Isac-AS/40982-Vision-por-Computador/tree/main/VC_P4_Isac)
Will simply add clown features to any face recognized.

## [Assignment 3 - Contour recognition and object classification](https://github.com/Isac-AS/40982-Vision-por-Computador/tree/main/P3)
In this assignment, coins and microplastics were classified based on contour features. The classification was highly heuristic.

## [Assignment 2 - Borders and images](https://github.com/Isac-AS/40982-Vision-por-Computador/tree/main/P2)
Several filters and operations were done on images in order to get familiarized with OpenCV.
